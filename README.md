# Sudoku

#### Introduction

The aim of this task was to create an agent which was able that was able to solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles. I did this using a backtracking depth first search and constraint propagation. This initial algorithm worked but struggled to solve the hard puzzles within the 20 second time limit, so I added a naked pairs algorithm which is a technique used in sudoku solving.
